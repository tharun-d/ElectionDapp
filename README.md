3. Run the development console.
    ```javascript
    truffle develop
    ```

4. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with `truffle`.
    ```javascript
    compile
    migrate
    ```

5. Run the `liteserver` development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    // Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000
    npm run dev
    ```

## FAQ

* __How do I use this with the EthereumJS TestRPC?__

    It's as easy as modifying the config file! [Check out our documentation on adding network configurations](http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration#networks). Depending on the port you're using, you'll also need to update line 16 of `src/js/app.js`.
